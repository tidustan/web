# Simpler-Sidebar
[![Flattr Button](https://button.flattr.com/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=dcdeiv&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdcdeiv%2Fsimpler-sidebar)

A simple jQuery sidebar.

* [Simpler-Sidebar Home Page](http://dcdeiv.github.io/simpler-sidebar)
* Simpler-Sidebar is forked from [Simple-Sidebar](http://www.github.com/dcdeiv/simple-sidebar).

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/simpler-sidebar.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/simpler-sidebar/)

### Simpler-Sidebar vs. Simple-Sidebar
* Stop supporting `subwrapper`.
* Animating only the sidebar and not the entire page.

#### Why this changes?
* You should know how to let the sidebar content overflow (if not check out [Getting Started](#Getting-Started)). To shrink the code, I decided to get rid of this feature.
* Animating the entire page was often an issue, `position: fixed` and `position: absolute` elements didn't animate the way they should, so I decided to only animate the sidebar.

## Getting Started
Download the [production version][min] of the [development version][max].

[min]: https://raw.github.com/dcdeiv/simpler-sidebar/master/dist/simpler-sidebar.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/dcdeiv/simpler-sidebar/master/dist/simpler-sidebar.js

Simpler-Sidebar is also available via **NPM** and **Bower**:

* `bower install simpler-sidebar`.
* `npm install simpler-sidebar`.

This fork is simpler than Simple-Sidebar because you won't need to do much more than this:

```html
<div id="navbar">
	<!--
	#navbar is positioned fixed.

	It does not matter what element #toggle-sidebar is, give it a selector (in this example #toggle-sidebar).
	-->
	<span id="toggle-sidebar" class="button icon"></span>
</div>

<div id="sidebar">
    <!--
    Simpler-Sidebar will handle #sidebar's position.

    To let the content of your sidebar overflow, especially when you have a lot of content in it, you have to add a "wrapper" that wraps all content.
    -->
    <div id="sidebar-wrapper" class="sidebar-wrapper">
        <!--
        Links below are just an example. Give each clickable element, for example links, a class to trigger the closing animation.
        -->
        <a class="close-sidebar" href="#">Link</a>
        <a class="close-sidebar" href="#">Link</a>
        <a class="close-sidebar" href="#">Link</a>
        <a class="close-sidebar" href="#">Link</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

If you add the sidebar-wrapper (and you should), remember to give it this style attributes:

```css
.sidebar-wrapper {
    position: relative;
    height: 100%;
    overflow: auto;
}
```

At the bottom of the web page, just before the `</body>` tag, include the **jQuery** library. If you are interested in better *easing*, include the **jQuery-UI** library too. Eventually include Simpler-Sidebar.

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
<script src="simpler-sidebar/dist/jquery.simpler-sidebar.min.js"></script>
```

Call the Simpler-Sidebar plug-in function and fill it with the options you need. Here is an example of some required options.

```html
<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#sidebar').simplerSidebar({
            opener: '#toggle-sidebar',
            sidebar: {
                align: 'left', //or 'right' - This option can be ignored, the sidebar will automatically align to right.
                width: 300, //You can ignore this option, the sidebar will automatically size itself to 300px.
                closingLinks: '.close-sidebar' // If you ignore this option, the plug-in will look for all links and this can be buggy. Choose a class for every object inside the sidebar that once clicked will close the sidebar.
            }
        });
    });
</script>
```

## OPTIONS
This is a full list of options.
You can override the single option by using the plug-in API or directly in the function.

### How to use the public access to plug-in options:
The base API is `$.fn.simplerSidebar.settings`. Check [Options List](#Options-List) out to see the full list of APIs available.

```javascript
$.fn.simplerSidebar.opener = '#toggle-sidebar';
$.fn.simplerSidebar.attr = 'simplersidebar';
$.fn.simplerSidebar.top = 42;
$.fn.simplerSidebar.animation.duration = 500;
$.fn.simplerSidebar.animation.duration = 'easeOutQuint';
$.fn.simplerSidebar.sidebar.align = 'left';
$.fn.simplerSidebar.sidebar.width = 300;
$.fn.simplerSidebar.sidebar.gap = 64;
$.fn.simplerSidebar.sidebar.closingLinks = '.close-sidebar';
$.fn.simplerSidebar.sidebar.css.zIndex = 3000;
$.fn.simplerSidebar.mask.display = true;
$.fn.simplerSidebar.mask.css.backgroundColor = 'black';
$.fn.simplerSidebar.mask.css.opacity = 0.5;
$.fn.simplerSidebar.mask.css.filter = 'Alpha(opacity=50)';

$( '#sidebar' ).simplerSidebar();
```
Overriding multiple options can be buggy, especially when you try to override `sidebar`, the plug-in will crash.

```javascript
$.fn.simplerSidebar.settings.mask.css = {
	//your style
};
```

### Options List
* **opener**: selector for the button/icon that will trigger the animation.
* **attr**: is the `data-*` attribute that makes the plug-in works. If `simplersidebar` is somehow causing you issues, you can change it.
* **top**: is the `position-top` of the entire plug-in. You can choose whatever number you want (better if you choose it according to the navbar's height) or let it be 0 by ignoring it.
* **animation**:
  * **duration**: the duration of the animation in milliseconds.
  * **easing**: the type of animation. For more animations include the *jQuery-UI* library and check out [this page](https://jqueryui.com/easing/). I strongly suggest not to play with easing because they haven't been tested all yet. I suggest to use simple easing like `easeOutQuint`.
* **sidebar**:
  * **align**: default is `undefined` which means that is aligned to *right*. If you want to align it to left, write `left`.
  * **width**: the max width of the sidebar, this option is default to 300, please change it as you please.
  * **gap**: the gap is the space between the left margin of the sidebar and the left side of the window (and viceversa). It is useful so that the user can click that space to close the sidebar.
  * **closingLinks**: links or elements that close the sidebar. I suggest to choose a class and give it to all links and other elements such as icons, banner, images, etc, that are links or that are supposed to be clicked. By default it is `a` so every link in the sidebar will close the sidebar. It can be more then one.
  * **css**: here you can store all css, anyway I suggest not to add more css attributes to the one below.
    * **zIndex**: by default is is 3000 but you have to change it to the higher z-index number in your css plus 1.
* **mask**:
  * **display**: `true` or `false`. `false` will remove this option.
  * **css**: here you can store all css attributes to give the mask div. However I suggest to do it in your css file except for these below. You can call this div by its data attribute for example: `[data-simplersidebar="mask"]`.
    * **backgroundColor**: the color of the mask. By default is `'black'`.
    * **opacity**: by default is 0.5.
    * **filter**: IE opacity 0.5 = 50 and so on: `'Alpha(opacity=50)'`.
